# Auth Store

This folder is intended to contain the state management logic for authentication, such as:
- Redux slices (e.g., user authentication, session management)
- Context providers (if used) for authentication-related state
- Actions and reducers for authentication (if using Redux)
- Any other state management logic specific to authentication

[PLEASE DELETE THIS TXT once the store logic is added]
