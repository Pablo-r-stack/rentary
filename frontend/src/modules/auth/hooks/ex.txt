# Auth Hooks

This folder is intended to contain custom hooks related to authentication, such as:
- `useAuth`: Hook for accessing the current authentication state (e.g., is the user logged in?)
- `useLogin`: Custom hook to handle login logic
- `useRegister`: Custom hook to handle registration logic
- Any other hooks that abstract authentication-related behavior

[PLEASE DELETE THIS TXT once the hooks are added]
